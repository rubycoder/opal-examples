7. [Opal-pixi example](../../tree/7-opal-pixi-example)

  Pixi is an amazing javascript library for 2d game creation and this example just scratches the surface. The opal wrapper is a very early release not really giving much, and desperately needs updating to the latest version of pixi.js, however this is a working example. This demo also uses the rack based setup which makes the directory structure simpler to follow. To run, just `bundle exec rack up`. Don't forget to `bundle install` first though!
